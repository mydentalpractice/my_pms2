      <!--Body Start-->         
            <p>I UNDERSTAND that the treatment of my dentition involving the placement of composite resin fillings which may be more aesthetic in appearance than some of the conventional materials which have been traditionally used, such as silver amalgam or gold, may entail certain risks. There is also the possibility of failure to achieve the results which may be desired or expected. I agree to assume those risks which may occur even though care and diligence will be exercised by my treating dentist in rendering this treatment. These risks include possible unsuccessful results and/or failure which are associated with, but not limited to the following: </p>

            <p><b>1. Sensitivity of Teeth:</b> Often after preparation of teeth for the placement of any restoration, the prepared teeth may exhibit sensitivity. The sensitivity may be mild to severe. The sensitivity may last only for a short period of time or may last for much longer periods of time. If such sensitivity is persistent or lasts for much extended periods of time, I agree to notify the dentist inasmuch as this may be a sign of more serious problems. </p>

            <p><b>2. Risk of Fracture:</b> Inherent in the placement or replacement of any restoration is the possibility of the creation of small fracture lines in tooth structure. Sometimes these fractures may not be apparent at the time of removal of tooth structure and/or the previous filling and placement or replacement, but may manifest at a later time. </p>

            <p><b>3. Necessity for Root Canal Therapy:</b> When fillings are placed or replaced, the preparation of the teeth for fillings often necessitates the removal of tooth structure adequate to insure that the diseased or otherwise compromised tooth structure provides sound tooth structure for placement of the restoration. At times, this may lead to exposure or trauma to underlying pulp tissue. Should the pulp not heal, which often times is exhibited by extreme sensitivity or possible abscess, root canal treatment or extraction may be required. </p>

            <p><b>4. Injury to the Nerves:</b> There is a possibility of injury to the nerves of the lips, jaws, teeth, tongue, or other oral or facial tissues from any dental treatment, particularly those involving the administration of local anesthetics. The resulting numbness which may occur is usually temporary, but in rare instances could be permanent. </p>

            <p><b>5. Aesthetics or Appearance:</b> Effort will be made to closely approximate the natural tooth color. However, due to the fact that there are many factors which affect the shades of teeth, it may not be possible to exactly match the tooth coloration. Also, over a period of time, the composite fillings, because of mouth fluids, different foods eaten, smoking, etc. may cause the shade to change. The dentist has no control over these factors. </p>

            <p><b>6. Breakage, dislodgment or bond failure:</b> Due to extreme masticatory pressures or other traumatic forces, it is possible for composite resin fillings or aesthetic restorations bonded with composite resins to be dislodged or fractured. The resin-enamel bond may fail, resulting in leakage and recurrent decay. The dentist has no control over these factors. </p>

            <p><b>7. New Technology and Health Issues:</b> Composite resin technology continues to advance but some materials yield disappointing results over time and some fillings may have to be replaced by better, improved materials. Some patients believe that having metal fillings replaced with composite filings will improve their general health. This notion has not been proven scientifically and there are no promises or guarantees that the removal of silver fillings and the subsequent replacement with composite fillings will improve, alleviate, or prevent any current or future health condition. </p>

            <p><b>8. I understand that it is my responsibility to notify this office should any undue or unexpected problems occur or if I experience any problems relating to the treatment rendered or the services performed.</b> </p>

           <p>I certify that I have read, have had explained to me, and fully understand the foregoing Consent to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">{{=dentalprocedure}}</span>,  drug and anesthetic procedures, and that it is my intention to have the foregoing carried out as stated. I have been advised of information concerning the longevity of the procedure. However, I have discussed this as well as the nature of the services and procedures and I consent to the above procedure knowing its risks and limitations.</p>
